Everything begins with food—from our individual health to the health of our communities and of the land that feeds us. **I craft data-driven policy to effect change within our food system.**

Based in Missoula, Montana, I spend my free time trail running with my German Wirehaired Pointer, climbing peaks, and just generally playing outside.
