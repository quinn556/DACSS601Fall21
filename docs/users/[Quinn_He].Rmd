I am a recent graduate of UMass Amherst with a BA in English. I'm from Wayne, New Jersey. 
My main interest revolves around Cambridge Analytica and how the firm harvested data 
from Facebook and used it to sow misinformation and create polarization 
in various different settings, with repercussions still felt today. 
It's both horrendous, yet fascinating. My hobbies include reading, writing, and guitar.
My R experience is essentially none. I took Psych240, but that's it.
